# Lets work together and find Satoshi's lost Bitcoin and help return it to the bitcoin ecosystem !!

step 1) download and save all bitcoin addresses into the local folder, this is a 2.6GB file so will take a while, click on the file from:
https://www.bitkeys.work/faq.php 

step 2) pip install -r requirements.txt

step 3) Create a WordList you wish to test, save it locally as MyWordList.txt, or use the random generator option later on

step 4) > python hunter.py            (or > python3 hunter.py)
# all your results files will be in the gitignore, so they won't shared back to github (private keys etc)
