# Lets work together and find Satoshi's lost Bitcoin and help return it to the bitcoin ecosystem !!

step 1) download and save all bitcoin addresses into the local folder, this is a 2.6GB file so will take a while, click on the file from:
https://www.bitkeys.work/faq.php 

step 2) pip install -r requirements.txt _______only requires bitcoin, so unlikely to need a virt env, this was built using python 3.9.1, anything 3x should work

step 3) Create a WordList you wish to test, save it locally as MyWordList.txt, (or use the random generator option later on when I've built it)

step 4) > python hunter.py  _____ (OR > python3 hunter.py)

all your results files will be in the gitignore, so they won't shared back to github (private keys, seedlists etc)

* This is the first program I've ever written, so please ask if you have questions
